And, to create that node the two functions\r\n *   associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\r\n * \r\n *   Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node.\r\n *   It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes\r\n *   can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the\r\n *   use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\r\n * \r\n *   `reg-sub` arguments are:\r\n * \r\n *  - a `query-id` (typically a namespaced keyword)\r\n *  - a function which returns the inputs required by this kind of node (can be supplied  in one of three ways)\r\n *  - a function which computes the value of this kind of node (can be supplied in one of three ways)\r\n * \r\n *   The `computation function` is always the last argument supplied and has three ways to be called.\r\n *   Two of these methods are syntactic sugar to provide easier access to functional abstractions around your data.\r\n * \r\n *   1. A function that will accept two parameters, the `input-values` and `query-vector`. This is the\r\n *   standard way to provide a `computation-function`\r\n * \r\n *        #!clj\r\n *        (reg-sub\r\n *          :query-id\r\n *          (fn [input-values query-vector]\r\n *            (:foo input-values)))\r\n * \r\n *   2. A single sugary tuple of `:->` and a 1-arity `computation-function`:\r\n * \r\n *        #!clj\r\n *        (reg-sub\r\n *          :query-id\r\n *          :-> computation-fn)\r\n * \r\n *    This sugary variation allows you to pass a function that will expect only one parameter,\r\n *    namely the `input-values` and entirely omit the `query-vector`. A typical `computation-function`\r\n *    expects two parameters which can cause unfortunate results when attempting to use\r\n *    clojure standard library functions, or other functions, in a functional manner.\r\n * \r\n *    For example, a significant number of subscriptions exist only to get a value\r\n *    from the `input-values`. As shown below, this subscription will simply retrieve\r\n *    the value associated with the `:foo` key in our db:\r\n * \r\n *        #!clj\r\n *        (reg-sub\r\n *          :query-id\r\n *          (fn [db _]    ;; :<---- trivial boilerplate we might want to skip over\r\n *            (:foo db)))\r\n * \r\n *    This is slightly more boilerplate than we might like to do,\r\n *    as we can use a keyword directly as a function, and we might like to do this:\r\n * \r\n *        #!clj\r\n *        (reg-sub\r\n *          :query-id\r\n *          :foo)  ;; :<---- This could be dangerous. If `:foo` is not in db, we get the `query-vector` instead of `nil`.\r\n * \r\n *    By using `:->` our function would not contain the `query-vector`, and any\r\n *    missing keys would be represented as such:\r\n * \r\n *        #!clj\r\n *        (reg-sub\r\n *          :query-id\r\n *          :-> :foo)\r\n * \r\n *    This form allows us to ignore the `query-vector` if our `computation-function`\r\n *    has no need for it, and be safe from any accidents. Any 1-arity function can be provided,\r\n *    and for more complicated use cases, `partial`, `comp`, and anonymous functions can still be used.\r\n * \r\n *   3. A single sugary tuple of `:=>` and a multi-arity `computation-function`\r\n * \r\n *        #!clj\r\n *        (reg-sub\r\n *          :query-id\r\n *          :=> computation-fn)\r\n * \r\n *    The `query-vector` can be broken into two components `[query-id & optional-values]`, and\r\n *    some subscriptions require the `optional-values` for extra work within the subscription.\r\n *    To use them in variation #1, we need to destructure our `computation-function` parameters\r\n *    in order to use them.\r\n * \r\n *        #!clj\r\n *        (reg-sub\r\n *          :query-id\r\n *          (fn [db [_ foo]]\r\n *            [db foo]))\r\n * \r\n *    Again we are writing boilerplate just to reach our values, and we might prefer to\r\n *    have direction access through a parameter vector like `[input-values optional-values]`\r\n *    instead, so we might be able to use a multi-arity function directly as our `computation-function`.\r\n *    A rewrite of the above sub using this sugary syntax would look like this:\r\n * \r\n *        #!clj\r\n *        (reg-sub\r\n *          :query-id\r\n *          :=> vector)  ;; :<---- Could also be `(fn [db foo] [db foo])`\r\n * \r\n *   The `computation function` is expected to take two arguments:\r\n * \r\n *  - `input-values` - the values which flow into this node (how is it wired into the graph?)\r\n *  - `query-vector` - the vector given to `subscribe`\r\n * \r\n *   and it returns a computed value (which then becomes the output of the node)\r\n * \r\n *   When `computation function` is called, the 2nd `query-vector` argument will be that\r\n *   vector supplied to the `subscribe`. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\r\n *   then the `query-vector` supplied to the computation function will be `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`.\r\n * \r\n *   The argument(s) supplied to `reg-sub` between `query-id` and the `computation-function`\r\n *   can vary in 3 ways, but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part\r\n *   of `the mechanism`, specifying what input values \"flow into\" the\r\n *   `computation function` (as the 1st argument) when it is called.\r\n * \r\n *   So, `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways\r\n *   to define the input signals part. But note, the 2nd method, in which a\r\n *   `signals function` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and\r\n *   instructive. The other two are really just sugary variations.\r\n * \r\n *   **First variation** - no input signal function given:\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (reg-sub\r\n *      :query-id\r\n *      a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\r\n * \r\n *   In the absence of an explicit `signals function`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\r\n *   and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\r\n *   given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\r\n * \r\n * \r\n *   **Second variation** - a signal function is explicitly supplied:\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (reg-sub\r\n *      :query-id\r\n *      signal-fn     ;; <-- here\r\n *      computation-fn)\r\n * \r\n *   This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\r\n * \r\n *   When a node is created from the template, the `signal function` will be called and it\r\n *   is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\r\n *   one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\r\n * \r\n *   The current values of the returned signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\r\n *   the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\r\n *   this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\r\n *   the structure returned by the `signal function`).\r\n * \r\n *   This example `signal function` returns a 2-vector of input signals.\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\r\n *       [(subscribe [:a-sub])\r\n *        (subscribe [:b-sub])])\r\n * \r\n *   The associated computation function must be written\r\n *   to expect a 2-vector of values for its first argument:\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\r\n *      ....)\r\n * \r\n *   If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\r\n *      (subscribe [:a-sub]))      ;; <-- returning a singleton\r\n * \r\n *   then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\r\n *   as the 1st argument:\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\r\n *       ...)\r\n * \r\n *   Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (reg-sub\r\n *      :query-id\r\n *      a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\r\n * \r\n *   is the equivalent of using this\r\n *   2nd variation and explicitly supplying a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (reg-sub\r\n *      :query-id\r\n *      (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit signal-fn\r\n *      a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\r\n * \r\n *   **Third variation** - syntax Sugar\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (reg-sub\r\n *      :a-b-sub\r\n *      :<- [:a-sub]\r\n *      :<- [:b-sub]\r\n *      (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\r\n *        {:a a :b b}))\r\n * \r\n *   This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\r\n *   `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\r\n * \r\n *   If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function,\r\n *   as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (reg-sub\r\n *      :a-sub\r\n *      :<- [:a-sub]\r\n *      (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\r\n *        ...))\r\n * \r\n *   Syntactic sugar for both the `signal-fn` and `computation-fn` can be used together\r\n *   and the direction of arrows shows the flow of data and functions. The example from\r\n *   directly above is reproduced here:\r\n * \r\n *    #!clj\r\n *    (reg-sub\r\n *      :a-b-sub\r\n *      :<- [:a-sub]\r\n *      :<- [:b-sub]\r\n *      :-> (partial zipmap [:a :b]))\r\n * \r\n *   For further understanding, read the tutorials, and look at the detailed comments in\r\n *   /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs.\r\n * \r\n *   See also: `subscribe`\r\n *   \r\n */\r\nre_frame.core.reg_sub = (function re_frame$core$reg_sub(var_args){\r\nvar args__5732__auto__ = [];\r\nvar len__5726__auto___13340 = arguments.length;\r\nvar i__5727__auto___13341 = (0);\r\nwhile(true){\r\nif((i__5727__auto___13341 < len__5726__auto___13340)){\r\nargs__5732__auto__.push((arguments[i__5727__auto___13341]));\r\n\r\nvar G__13342 = (i__5727__auto___13341 + (1));\r\ni__5727__auto___13341 = G__13342;\r\ncontinue;\r\n} else {\r\n}\r\nbreak;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar argseq__5733__auto__ = ((((1) < args__5732__auto__.length))?(new cljs.core.IndexedSeq(args__5732__auto__.slice((1)),(0),null)):null);\r\nreturn re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$variadic((arguments[(0)]),argseq__5733__auto__);\r\n});\r\n\r\n(re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$variadic = (function (query_id,args){\r\nreturn cljs.core.apply.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$3(re_frame.subs.reg_sub,query_id,args);\r\n}));\r\n\r\n(re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$lang$maxFixedArity = (1));\r\n\r\n/** @this {Function} */\r\n(re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$lang$applyTo = (function (seq13301){\r\nvar G__13302 = cljs.core.first(seq13301);\r\nvar seq13301__$1 = cljs.core.next(seq13301);\r\nvar self__5711__auto__ = this;\r\nreturn self__5711__auto__.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$variadic(G__13302,seq13301__$1);\r\n}));\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Given a `query` vector, returns a Reagent `reaction` which will, over\r\n *   time, reactively deliver a stream of values.

It will inspect all the todos, and\r\n *   reset ALL FLAGS every time (overwriting what was there previously)\r\n *   and fully recalculate the list of duplicates (displayed at the bottom?).\r\n * \r\n *   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520</a>\r\n * \r\n *   By applying `f` in an `:enrich` interceptor, after every CRUD event,\r\n *   we keep the handlers simple and yet we ensure this important step\r\n *   (of getting warnings right) is not missed on any change.\r\n * \r\n *   We can test `f` easily - it is a pure function - independently of\r\n *   any CRUD operation.\r\n * \r\n *   This brings huge simplicity at the expense of some re-computation\r\n *   each time.

When a node of type `query-id` is needed,\n  the two functions can be used to create it.\n\n  The three arguments are:\n\n    - `query-id` - typically a namespaced keyword (later used in subscribe)\n    - optionally, an `input signals` function which returns the input data\n      flows required by this kind of node.\n    - a `computation function` which computes the value (output) of the\n      node (from the input data flows)\n\n  Later, during app execution, a call to `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  will trigger the need for a new `:sub-id` Signal Graph node (matching the\n  query `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`). And, to create that node the two functions\n  associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\n\n  Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node.\n  It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes\n  can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the\n  use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\n\n  `reg-sub` arguments are:\n\n    - a `query-id` (typically a namespaced keyword)\n    - a function which returns the inputs required by this kind of node (can be supplied  in one of three ways)\n    - a function which computes the value of this kind of node (can be supplied in one of three ways)\n\n  The `computation function` is always the last argument supplied and has three ways to be called.\n  Two of these methods are syntactic sugar to provide easier access to functional abstractions around your data.\n\n  1. A function that will accept two parameters, the `input-values` and `query-vector`. This is the\n     standard way to provide a `computation-function`\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            (fn [input-values query-vector]\n              (:foo input-values)))\n\n  2. A single sugary tuple of `:->` and a 1-arity `computation-function`:\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            :-> computation-fn)\n\n      This sugary variation allows you to pass a function that will expect only one parameter,\n      namely the `input-values` and entirely omit the `query-vector`. A typical `computation-function`\n      expects two parameters which can cause unfortunate results when attempting to use\n      clojure standard library functions, or other functions, in a functional manner.\n\n      For example, a significant number of subscriptions exist only to get a value\n      from the `input-values`. As shown below, this subscription will simply retrieve\n      the value associated with the `:foo` key in our db:\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            (fn [db _]    ;; :<---- trivial boilerplate we might want to skip over\n              (:foo db)))\n\n      This is slightly more boilerplate than we might like to do,\n      as we can use a keyword directly as a function, and we might like to do this:\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            :foo)  ;; :<---- This could be dangerous. If `:foo` is not in db, we get the `query-vector` instead of `nil`.\n\n      By using `:->` our function would not contain the `query-vector`, and any\n      missing keys would be represented as such:\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            :-> :foo)\n\n      This form allows us to ignore the `query-vector` if our `computation-function`\n      has no need for it, and be safe from any accidents. Any 1-arity function can be provided,\n      and for more complicated use cases, `partial`, `comp`, and anonymous functions can still be used.\n\n  3. A single sugary tuple of `:=>` and a multi-arity `computation-function`\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            :=> computation-fn)\n\n      The `query-vector` can be broken into two components `[query-id & optional-values]`, and\n      some subscriptions require the `optional-values` for extra work within the subscription.\n      To use them in variation #1, we need to destructure our `computation-function` parameters\n      in order to use them.\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            (fn [db [_ foo]]\n              [db foo]))\n\n      Again we are writing boilerplate just to reach our values, and we might prefer to\n      have direction access through a parameter vector like `[input-values optional-values]`\n      instead, so we might be able to use a multi-arity function directly as our `computation-function`.\n      A rewrite of the above sub using this sugary syntax would look like this:\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            :=> vector)  ;; :<---- Could also be `(fn [db foo] [db foo])`\n\n  The `computation function` is expected to take two arguments:\n\n    - `input-values` - the values which flow into this node (how is it wired into the graph?)\n    - `query-vector` - the vector given to `subscribe`\n\n  and it returns a computed value (which then becomes the output of the node)\n\n  When `computation function` is called, the 2nd `query-vector` argument will be that\n  vector supplied to the `subscribe`. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  then the `query-vector` supplied to the computation function will be `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`.\n\n  The argument(s) supplied to `reg-sub` between `query-id` and the `computation-function`\n  can vary in 3 ways, but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part\n  of `the mechanism`, specifying what input values \\\"flow into\\\" the\n  `computation function` (as the 1st argument) when it is called.\n\n  So, `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways\n  to define the input signals part. But note, the 2nd method, in which a\n  `signals function` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and\n  instructive. The other two are really just sugary variations.\n\n  **First variation** - no input signal function given:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n     In the absence of an explicit `signals function`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n     and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n     given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\n\n\n  **Second variation** - a signal function is explicitly supplied:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n        computation-fn)\n\n  This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n\n  When a node is created from the template, the `signal function` will be called and it\n  is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n  one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n\n  The current values of the returned signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\n  the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\n  this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n  the structure returned by the `signal function`).\n\n  This example `signal function` returns a 2-vector of input signals.\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n\n  The associated computation function must be written\n  to expect a 2-vector of values for its first argument:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n        ....)\n\n  If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n        (subscribe [:a-sub]))      ;; <-- returning a singleton\n\n  then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n  as the 1st argument:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n         ...)\n\n  Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n  is the equivalent of using this\n  2nd variation and explicitly supplying a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit signal-fn\n        a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n  **Third variation** - syntax Sugar\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-b-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        :<- [:b-sub]\n        (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n          {:a a :b b}))\n\n  This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n  `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n\n  If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function,\n  as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n          ...))\n\n  Syntactic sugar for both the `signal-fn` and `computation-fn` can be used together\n  and the direction of arrows shows the flow of data and functions. The example from\n  directly above is reproduced here:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-b-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        :<- [:b-sub]\n        :-> (partial zipmap [:a :b]))\n\n  For further understanding, read the tutorials, and look at the detailed comments in\n  /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs.\n\n  See also: `subscribe`\n  \"\n  {:api-docs/heading \"Subscriptions\"}\n  [query-id & args]\n  (apply subs/reg-sub query-id args))\n\n(defn subscribe\n  \"Given a `query` vector, returns a Reagent `reaction` which will, over\n  time, reactively deliver a stream of values.

Perhaps it needs access to a DataScript database connection.\n\n  If an event handler directly accesses these resources, it stops being\n  pure and, consequently, it becomes harder to test, etc. So we don't\n  want that.\n\n  Instead, the interceptor created by this function is a way to 'inject'\n  'necessary resources' into the `:coeffects` (map) subsequently given\n  to the event handler at call time.\n\n  See also `reg-cofx`\n  \"\n  {:api-docs/heading \"Coeffects\"}\n  ([id]\n   (cofx/inject-cofx id))\n  ([id value]\n   (cofx/inject-cofx id value)))\n\n(defn clear-cofx ;; think unreg-cofx\n  \"Unregisters coeffect handlers (presumably registered previously via the use of `reg-cofx`).\n\n  When called with no args, it will unregister all currently registered coeffect handlers.\n\n  When given one arg, assumed to be the `id` of a previously registered\n  coeffect handler, it will unregister the associated handler.

See examples/todomvc/src/events.cljs for use.\n\n  Output includes:\n\n    1. the event vector\n    2. a `clojure.data/diff` of db, before vs after, which shows\n       the changes caused by the event handler. To understand the output,\n       you should understand:\n       <a href=\\\"https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.data/diff\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.data/diff</a>.\n\n  You'd typically include this interceptor after (to the right of) any\n  `path` interceptor.\n\n  Warning:  calling `clojure.data/diff` on large, complex data structures\n  can be slow. So, you won't want this interceptor present in production\n  code. So, you should condition it out like this:\n\n      #!clj\n      (re-frame.core/reg-event-db\n        :evt-id\n        [(when ^boolean goog.DEBUG re-frame.core/debug)]  ;; <-- conditional\n        (fn [db v]\n           ...))\n\n  To make this code fragment work, you'll also have to set `goog.DEBUG` to\n  `false` in your production builds. For an example, look in `project.clj` of /examples/todomvc.\n  \"\n  std-interceptors/debug)\n\n(defn path\n  \"Returns an interceptor which acts somewhat like `clojure.core/update-in`, in the sense that\n  the event handler is given a specific part of `app-db` to change, not all of `app-db`.\n\n  The interceptor has both a `:before` and `:after` functions. The `:before` replaces\n  the `:db` key within coeffects with a sub-path within `app-db`. The `:after` reverses the process,\n  and it grafts the handler's return value back into db, at the right path.\n\n  Examples:\n\n      #!clj\n      (path :some :path)\n      (path [:some :path])\n      (path [:some :path] :to :here)\n      (path [:some :path] [:to] :here)\n\n  Example Use:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-event-db\n        :event-id\n        (path [:a :b])  ;; <-- used here, in interceptor chain\n        (fn [b v]       ;; 1st arg is not db. Is the value from path [:a :b] within db\n          ... new-b))   ;; returns a new value for that path (not the entire db)\n\n  Notes:\n\n    1. `path` may appear more than once in an interceptor chain. Progressive narrowing.\n    2. if `:effects` contains no `:db` effect, can't graft a value back in.\n  \"\n  {:api-docs/heading \"Interceptors\"}\n  [& args]\n  (apply std-interceptors/path args))\n\n(defn enrich\n  \"Returns an interceptor which will run the given function `f` in the `:after`\n  position.\n\n  `f` is called with two arguments: `db` and `event`, and is expected to\n  return a modified `db`.\n\n  Unlike the `after` interceptor which is only about side effects, `enrich`\n  expects `f` to process and alter the given `db` coeffect in some useful way,\n  contributing to the derived data, flowing vibe.\n\n  If `f` returns `nil`, the `db` value passed to `f` will be returned instead.\n\n  #### Example Use:\n\n  Imagine that todomvc needed to do duplicate detection - if any two todos had\n  the same text, then highlight their background, and report them via a warning\n  at the bottom of the panel.\n\n  Almost any user action (edit text, add new todo, remove a todo) requires a\n  complete reassessment of duplication errors and warnings. E.g. that edit\n  just made might have introduced a new duplicate, or removed one. Same with\n  any todo removal. So we need to re-calculate warnings after any CRUD events\n  associated with the todos list.\n\n  Unless we are careful, we might end up coding subtly different checks\n  for each kind of CRUD operation.  The duplicates check made after\n  'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\n  editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\n  approach.\n\n  So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\n  every time there is ANY change. It will inspect all the todos, and\n  reset ALL FLAGS every time (overwriting what was there previously)\n  and fully recalculate the list of duplicates (displayed at the bottom?).\n\n  <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520</a>\n\n  By applying `f` in an `:enrich` interceptor, after every CRUD event,\n  we keep the handlers simple and yet we ensure this important step\n  (of getting warnings right) is not missed on any change.\n\n  We can test `f` easily - it is a pure function - independently of\n  any CRUD operation.\n\n  This brings huge simplicity at the expense of some re-computation\n  each time. This may be a very satisfactory trade-off in many cases.\n\n  #### Returning nil\n\n  In some cases, it's useful to apply a change to specific situations that can\n  be determined at runtime instead of when defining the handler with an\n  `:enrich` interceptor. Instead of forcing you to return the `db` from every\n  non-applicable branch, you can return `nil` to use the given `db` value:\n\n      #!clj\n      (def set-last-update\n        (core/enrich\n          (fn [{db :db} [_ {user :user}]]\n            (when (active-user? user)  ;; <- Only perform an update if user is active\n              ...))))\n  \"\n  {:api-docs/heading \"Interceptors\"}\n  [f]\n  (std-interceptors/enrich f))\n\n(def ^{:api-docs/heading \"Interceptors\"} unwrap\n  \"> New in v1.2.0\n\n   An interceptor which decreases the amount of destructuring necessary in an\n   event handler where the event is structured as a 2-vector of\n   [event-id payload-map].\n\n   It promotes the `payload-map` part to be the event ultimately given to the\n   event handler.

So we need to re-calculate warnings after any CRUD events\n  associated with the todos list.\n\n  Unless we are careful, we might end up coding subtly different checks\n  for each kind of CRUD operation.  The duplicates check made after\n  'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\n  editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\n  approach.\n\n  So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\n  every time there is ANY change. It will inspect all the todos, and\n  reset ALL FLAGS every time (overwriting what was there previously)\n  and fully recalculate the list of duplicates (displayed at the bottom?).\n\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520</a>\n\n  By applying `f` in an `:enrich` interceptor, after every CRUD event,\n  we keep the handlers simple and yet we ensure this important step\n  (of getting warnings right) is not missed on any change.\n\n  We can test `f` easily - it is a pure function - independently of\n  any CRUD operation.\n\n  This brings huge simplicity at the expense of some re-computation\n  each time. This may be a very satisfactory trade-off in many cases.\n\n  #### Returning nil\n\n  In some cases, it's useful to apply a change to specific situations that can\n  be determined at runtime instead of when defining the handler with an\n  `:enrich` interceptor.

And, to create that node the two functions\n  associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\n\n  Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node.\n  It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes\n  can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the\n  use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\n\n  `reg-sub` arguments are:\n\n    - a `query-id` (typically a namespaced keyword)\n    - a function which returns the inputs required by this kind of node (can be supplied  in one of three ways)\n    - a function which computes the value of this kind of node (can be supplied in one of three ways)\n\n  The `computation function` is always the last argument supplied and has three ways to be called.\n  Two of these methods are syntactic sugar to provide easier access to functional abstractions around your data.\n\n  1. A function that will accept two parameters, the `input-values` and `query-vector`. This is the\n     standard way to provide a `computation-function`\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            (fn [input-values query-vector]\n              (:foo input-values)))\n\n  2. A single sugary tuple of `:->` and a 1-arity `computation-function`:\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            :-> computation-fn)\n\n      This sugary variation allows you to pass a function that will expect only one parameter,\n      namely the `input-values` and entirely omit the `query-vector`. A typical `computation-function`\n      expects two parameters which can cause unfortunate results when attempting to use\n      clojure standard library functions, or other functions, in a functional manner.\n\n      For example, a significant number of subscriptions exist only to get a value\n      from the `input-values`. As shown below, this subscription will simply retrieve\n      the value associated with the `:foo` key in our db:\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            (fn [db _]    ;; :<---- trivial boilerplate we might want to skip over\n              (:foo db)))\n\n      This is slightly more boilerplate than we might like to do,\n      as we can use a keyword directly as a function, and we might like to do this:\n\n          #!clj\n          (reg-sub\n            :query-id\n            :foo)  ;; :<---- This could be dangerous.

When a node of type `query-id` is needed,\n  the two functions can be used to create it.\n\n  The three arguments are:\n\n    - `query-id` - typically a namespaced keyword (later used in subscribe)\n    - optionally, an `input signals` function which returns the input data\n      flows required by this kind of node.\n    - a `computation function` which computes the value (output) of the\n      node (from the input data flows)\n\n  Later, during app execution, a call to `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  will trigger the need for a new `:sub-id` Signal Graph node (matching the\n  query `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`). And, to create that node the two functions\n  associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\n\n  Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node.\n  It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes\n  can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the\n  use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\n\n  `reg-sub` arguments are:\n\n    - a `query-id` (typically a namespaced keyword)\n    - a function which returns the inputs required by this kind of node (can be supplied  in one of three ways)\n    - a function which computes the value of this kind of node (can be supplied in one of three ways)\n\n  The `computation function` is always the last argument supplied and has three ways to be called.\n  Two of these methods are syntactic sugar to provide easier access to functional abstractions around your data.\n\n  1.
